1. Test Scores #1
Create a New Project called YourLastnameSortScores.
Write a program that dynamically allocates an array large enough to hold a user-defined number of
test scores. Once all the scores are entered, the array should be passed to a function that sorts them
in ascending order. Another function should be called that calculates the average score. The program
should display the sorted list of scores and averages with appropriate headings. Use pointer notation
rather than array notation whenever possible.
Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for test scores.
